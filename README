To install PWDFT, do

  (1) cp /build/make.inc.spin-kpoints ./make.inc
  
  (2) modify the path of libraries in env.sh and make.inc

      set USE_GPU as 1 to compile GPU version
    
      set USE_COMPLEX as 1 to compile complex version

      USE_GPU and USE_COMPLEX are not compatible by now

  (3) source env.sh

  (3) sh compile.sh

  the executable file is generated in /examples as pwdft
